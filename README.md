# GoodJobHunting
A utility to help employees find a salaried job directly at a company (no LinkedIn/Indeed/ZipRecruiter etc.).  Also, it is for making the statistics of everyone's job search available to the public.  It's a sad time we live in where finding a job is more difficult than the jobs themselves, and the rampant proliferation of so-called "Ghost Jobs".
